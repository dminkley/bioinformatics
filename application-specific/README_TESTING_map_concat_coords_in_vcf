September 4th, 2018:

I compared the Palti 57k omyk SNP vcf file vs its output from the program.  Specifically, I checked:
- All non-unplaced scaffold/non-mito lines are identical between the two VCFs, as they should be
- Coordinates for the following lines are all properly mapped:
	- First three NW_* lines
	- Last marker in Super_Scaffold0
	- First marker that is in Super_Scaffold1
	- Last marker in the whole set (in Super_Scaffold3)
- I checked that the actual base in the relevent Super_Scaffold matched the 'REF' base in the final
  VCF file, as it should, for the following (they all matched):
	- First three NW_* markers
	- Last three markers in Super_Scaffold0
	- First three markers in Super_Scaffold1
	- Last three markers in the whole set (in Super_Scaffold3)
- Both files have the same number of lines.
- The 'fileDate' header field is properly updated to the date the program was run
- The 'reference' header field is properly updated to the filename supplied (which should be the 'concat' file)
